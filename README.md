# Hackerhotel 2020 badge
We hope you enjoyed the event!

# Using the design
Should you want to use this design for your own badges then keep in mind that the LED footprints are reversed. Because of this the current design is only suitable for manual assembly! Should you find time to create a version with the LED footprints the right way round (or with the transistors moved to the other side of the LEDs...) then please let us know by creating a pull request.
